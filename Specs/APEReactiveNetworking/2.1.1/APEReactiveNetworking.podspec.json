  "summary": "APEReactiveNetworking is simply a reactive oriented, lightweight networking library, made by Apegroup",
  "description": "We focused on building a network lib that was real-world, use-case oriented (looking at what our existing app projects actually used/needed from a networking lib) rather than implementing all sorts of functions any given project would possibly use.\n\nIt's lightweight because we deliberately did not implement features, available in other networking libs, that are seldom used, for example multipart request-body support. Why create waste?\n\nIt's reactive based because we built it on top of ReactiveSwift, which is an aswesome lib that we think will be the best Reactive lib for the Apple platforms.\n\nAPEReactiveNetworking is implemented purley in Swift 3 and powering the magic of Swift Generics. Its used in production by BLOX iOS app among others.",
